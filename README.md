# Welcome to the MKT Playbook (git)hub!

Hey there! Fancy seeing you here. Welcome to the official MKT Playbook hub. A place where you can report bugs, request new features, or ask questions. Check out the sections down below to get started.

## I found a bug! What now?

Great! Well, great that you found your way here. Not so great that you are experiencing an issue. But don't worry! Rescue is only a few clicks away!

### Search for existing bugs

Before jumping in I encourage you to look up the existing bug reports. Maybe your issue has already been reported. If so you can add more information through a comment.

> You can search for issues by switching to the [Issues](https://github.com/MKT-Playbook/Hub/issues) tab and entering the best-fitting keyword into the search bar.

Often, the biggest obstacle in resolving a bug is figuring out how to reproduce it. So if you found the steps that lead to the bug and those steps aren’t yet included in the existing bug report, it would be a huge help if you could add them there in the comments.

### Create a new bug report

You haven’t found your issue? No problem! Time to create a new report.

> 1. First, you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). It is super fast (and free) to set up.
> 2. Now that that's out of the way the real fun can begin. Switch back to the [Issues](https://github.com/MKT-Playbook/Hub/issues) tab and click on “New Issue”.
> 3. Select “Bug report” by clicking “Get started” on the first item.
> 4. Choose a clear and concise title, so other users can find your issue.
> 5. Fill out as much of the requested information as possible as this will greatly speed up the debugging process.
> *(You can delete everything in italic or framed by an underscore “_”)*
> 6. Click on “Preview” to see if everything is looking good and revise things if necessary.
> 7. Submit the bug report by clicking “Submit new issue”.

Done! I will now start working on fixing the issue. Well, at least as soon as I can. If I need any more information I will get back to you through the comments.

Also please keep in mind that I am developing the app on my own and only in my free time, so it might take a bit until the issue gets fixed. I hope you will excuse any time spend waiting around.

## I have a cool new idea for the app!

Wonderful! I am excited to hear what you got. Jump over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/MKT-Playbook/Hub/discussions) tab to see what others have already suggested and to create a new feature request.

## I have a question

Of course. Check out my fancy [FAQ](https://www.notion.so/MKT-Playbook-FAQ-9ffc72de666042ff89fbab7e728ead39). Maybe you can find the answer you are looking for right there. If not, don’t hessite to reach out to me or the community. Here is a list of possible contact points:
